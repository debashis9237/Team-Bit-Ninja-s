# 🏆 HackVerse - Team Repository

Welcome to your official team repository! This is your workspace for the duration of the hackathon. Please read the rules and evaluation guidelines carefully before you begin coding.

## Hackathon Rules & Evaluation Process

To ensure fairness and track your progress, this hackathon features a strict two-phase evaluation process. **You must push your code to this repository to be evaluated.** Code residing only on your local machines will not be graded.

### Evaluation 1: The Midpoint Check
* **Deadline:** 12:15 PM
* **Requirement:** You must have your initial project structure and foundational code pushed to the `main` branch. 
* **Purpose:** This check ensures your team is on track, actively collaborating, and has a viable concept in motion. Mentors/Judges will review your commit history and current progress.

### Evaluation 2: The Final Submission
* **Deadline:** 5:00 PM
* **Requirement:** Your completed project must be fully pushed to the `main` branch. 
* **Purpose:** This is the final version of your project that will be judged for the hackathon prizes.

### STRICT CODE FREEZE POLICY
**No modifications will be accepted after the Development Time ends at 5:00 PM.** Exactly at the deadline, all team repositories will be **Archived** and converted to **Read-Only**. 
* Any unpushed local commits will be lost and cannot be submitted.
* Late submissions, pull requests, or requests to add "just one last fix" will not be accepted under any circumstances.
* **Tip:** Push your code frequently! Do not wait until the last 5 minutes to push your entire project.
